# Chuck Norris Joke Generator

> Small disclaimer: the app was supposed to have more features but pretty much I am newbie in React so these were too hard for me to code them. I made as much as I could based on my experience in React. Whole coding process took me three days, during that I had to rewrite whole structure of the app several times after reviewing React documentation and threads on StackOverflow. I hope that the dev who was assigned to review my app won't be /disappointed/ by the lack of features mentioned in the task description compared with my code.
